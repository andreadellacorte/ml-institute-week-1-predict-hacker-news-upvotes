Pengertian TBC<p>Tuberkulosis atau TB (singkatan yang sekarang ditinggalkan adalah TBC) adalah penyakit infeksi yang disebabkan oleh bakteri Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Penyakit ini paling sering menyerang paru-paru walaupun pada sepertiga kasus menyerang organ tubuh lain dan ditularkan orang ke orang. Ini juga salah satu penyakit tertua yang diketahui menyerang manusia.
Tuberkulosis masih merupakan penyakit infeksi saluran napas yang tersering di Indonesia. Keterlambatan dalam menegakkan diagnosa dan ketidakpatuhan dalam menjalani pengobatan mempunyai dampak yang besar karena pasien Tuberkulosis akan menularkan penyakitnya pada lingkungan,sehingga jumlah penderita semakin bertambah.<p>Penularan<p>Penularan penyakit ini karena kontak dengan dahak atau menghirup titik-titik air dari bersin atau batuk dari orang yang terinfeksi kuman tuberkulosis, anak anak sering mendapatkan penularan dari orang dewasa di sekitar rumah maupun saat berada di fasilitas umum seperti kendaraan umum, rumah sakit dan dari lingkungan sekitar rumah. Oleh sebab ini masyarakat di Indonesia perlu sadar bila dirinya terdiagnosis tuberkulosis maka hati hati saat berinteraksi dengan orang lain agar tidak batuk sembarangan , tidak membuang ludah sembarangan dan sangat dianjurkan untuk bersedia memakai masker atau setidaknya sapu tangan atau tissue.<p>Dalam memerangi penyebaran Tuberkulosis terutama pada anak anak yang masih rentan daya tahan tubuhnya maka pemerintah Indonesia telah memasukkan Imunisasi Tuberkulosis pada anak anak yang disebut sebagai Imunisasi BCG sebagai salah satu program prioritas imunisasi wajib nasonal beserta dengan 4 jenis imunisasi wajib lainnya yaitu hepatitis B, Polio, DPT dan campak, jadwalnya ada di Jadwal imunisasi.

"Hey,<p>I'd like to share a little project idea I thought of a few months ago. I immediately liked it and felt like working on it, but I didn't have time. So I suggested it to a few of my friends, but they eventually didn't work on it either. So finally I'm posting it here, maybe someone here will do it, and if so I'd love to see the process and the result.<p>It's like this:<p>Make an algorithm that, given results of a poll, guesses the number of people in the population.<p>For example: ""According to the poll, 18.75% of people prefer jazz music, 43.75% of people prefer rock, and 37.5% don't care.""<p>The algorithm will probably guess that only 16 people were asked in the poll.<p>Now I know, it's gonna get complicated, with probability distributions, rounding errors, heuristics, and whatnot. But I think it will be very interesting, and possibly there will scientific uses for this algorithm as well. Maybe this is a good subject for a paper.<p>The first step would probably be to phrase and solve this problem mathematically. This will require good knowledge of probability.

"I&#x27;m head of a Los Angeles atheist organization. We&#x27;re launching a weekly Toy Loan Center in partnership with Los Angeles County.<p>The County Toy Loan program is like a lending library for toys. Families are invited to borrow toys for free and return them a week later. Children are also rewarded with toys to keep when they return the toys on time and adhere to the program&#x27;s code of honor. In addition to the toys the County provides the center, we will be adding donated toys that help foster scientific and creative thinking.<p>I&#x27;m stocking up on toys to donate now. Which ones best teach children about scientific discovery and critical thinking?<p>Keep in mind, these toys have to be durable and reusable. A lot of the scientific toys are one-time use, like growing crystals or chemistry sets or are very fragile. That won&#x27;t work since we&#x27;d like to children take turns borrowing the toys.<p>Ideas to different kinds of toys and even direct links to Amazon and other online stores would be appreciated. Also, toy companies that specialize in these types of toys would be good to know.

"After being linked to this thread [link at bottom] on reddit which describes many college/university students anger at how bad the ""blackboard e-learning"" suite is I started to think about my experience with blackboard at my university. If you haven't used it, imagine web appplications from the late 90's!<p>This got me thinking, there are no 'really' good contenders in the e-learning market, of course blackboard has a few competitors in the open source and propietary markets but none of them are a great deal better.<p>I'm pretty sure me and a couple of guys from my comp sci school could create something significantly better than the current market leader (blackboard) within the space of 3 months (summer holiday).<p>Unless we go all out and run this like a startup business it will obviously go nowhere, do you  think this is something we should run with or would getting other schools to use it be to much of an uphill battle?<p>http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/81bk3/i_submit_a_paper_on_blackboard_called_hw_2docx/",159,Ask HN: E-learning startup and blackboard failure,159,1,-0.59336007,-0.4913508,-0.3237037,-0.51066905,-0.037704494,0.32535237,-0.4114323,-0.092420235,0.9915456,0.10492061,0.47494602,-0.16801655,-0.18703596,0.061281897,-0.19249439,0.38841867,-0.5000595,-0.3400052,0.21554762,-0.008697658,0.3691615,0.63546073,-0.71785563,0.65801185,-0.3619033,-0.12199761,-0.034249336,-0.85836273,-0.34938744,-0.4750486,-0.43246433,0.6461301,-0.7541794,0.3802644,-0.14100024,-0.04455248,0.25078136,0.13925047,-0.5595031,-0.15639842,-0.15332212,-0.60986304,0.6605056,-0.7016141,0.5470699,0.40992853,0.3226175,0.6095659,0.6091036,-0.13987362,0.23214245,0.47974628,0.045271643,0.44144943,0.09231207,-0.42927969,0.718984,-0.005623926,0.57586265,0.40522134,0.20725575,0.35977736,-0.517359,-0.5445468,0.5349874,0.1359165,0.97901386,-0.029052118,0.3889617,-0.14195004,0.06477074,-0.716556,-0.15993512,-0.0327535,0.50621927,-0.33884764,0.36593172,-0.11765334,-0.30111352,-0.011062772,0.28423953,-0.28025085,-0.45676315,0.080948815,1.0471785,-0.30216512,-0.92188114,0.98201936,0.025195846,0.14803843,-0.024451114,0.26941693,-0.3739271,-0.32732263,-0.12181258,0.10938214,-0.42639625,-0.53422505,-0.17496221,0.16128968,-0.3252267,-0.12378995,-0.22633627,-0.3127028,-0.04959908,0.16800292,-0.30220854,0.44970122,0.3891782,0.67737997,-0.101679705,-0.23416877,0.23090939,0.26492077,0.7020853,0.21741195,-0.52949744,-0.3641366,0.097314335,-0.116324805,0.48875493,-0.13638352,-1.1799467,-0.20557293,0.15718548,-0.076360606,-0.32935315,-0.08621599,-0.3632459,-0.12049594,0.28979498,0.6684797,-0.18602814,-0.037153333,-0.36182386,0.23232742,-0.15604979,-0.082269646,-0.12973087,-0.3644604,0.0076666265,-0.027339876,0.47958755,-0.38716167,0.10039093,0.19084793,0.61574423,0.30725652,-0.038084447,-0.08403059,0.06232488,0.33497125,0.32742077,-0.03138219,-0.16702095,-0.8006441,0.25698,0.38269886,0.056671083,0.084622815,-0.35110348,-0.2287591,0.014608195,-0.05579134,-0.0018324495,-0.3574429,0.8007147,0.028238606,-0.25349122,0.33297652,0.0534061,-0.35249895,-0.12202738,-0.09070387,-0.19264412,0.07358346,0.06922442,0.22962901,0.18782575,-0.154581,0.021402186,-0.46639776,-0.511328,-0.12170923,0.8273595,0.010414576,-0.16494167,-0.019336104,0.29624912,-0.079135045,0.031137919,-0.21269429,-0.87999517,0.10194632,0.11662461,0.59918183,0.029794812,-0.31421623,-0.10176198,-0.20159371

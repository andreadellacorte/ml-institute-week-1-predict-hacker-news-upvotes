Sometimes it&#x27;s because the developers want to signal effort to user and&#x2F;or upper management.<p>Maybe Mount and Blade was super boggy in the past and is <i>still</i> super buggy now so all the crashes fixed are just an indicator of how large the problem is for them and how bad the code still is.
